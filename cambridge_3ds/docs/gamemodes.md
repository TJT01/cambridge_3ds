Game modes
==========

There are several classes of game modes. The modes that originate from other games are organized by suffix:

* The "A" series stand for "Arika" games, or games in the Tetris the Grand Master series.
	* A1 - Tetris The Grand Master (the original from 1998).
	* A2 - Tetris The Absolute The Grand Master 2 PLUS.
	* A3 - Tetris The Grand Master 3 Terror-Instinct.
	* AX - Tetris The Grand Master ACE (X for Xbox).

MARATHON
--------

Modes in which the goal is to play as well as possible over a limited game interval.

* **MARATHON 2020**: 2020 levels of pure pain. Can you make it all the way?

From other games:
* **MARATHON A1**: Tetris the Grand Master 1.
* **MARATHON A2**: Tetris the Grand Master 2 (TAP Master).
* **MARATHON A3**: Tetris the Grand Master 3 (no exams).


SURVIVAL
--------

Modes that concentrate on how long you can survive an increasingly fast and difficult game.

* **SURVIVAL 2020**: It only gets worse from Marathon 2020. Beware of the total delay!

From other games:
* **SURVIVAL A1**: 20G mode from Tetris the Grand Master.
* **SURVIVAL A2**: T.A. Death.
* **SURVIVAL A3**: Ti Shirase.

PHANTOM MANIA
-------------

Modes where pieces turn invisible as soon as you lock them. One of Cambridge's signature features.

* **Phantom Mania**: The classic invisible mode from Nullpomino. Can you handle 999 levels of "the M roll"?

* **Phantom Mania 2**: Phantom Mania but way faster! Can you face a mode where even the garbage and the next preview turn invisible?



OTHER MODES
-----------

* **Strategy**: How well can you plan ahead your movements? Can you handle only having a short time to place each piece?

* **Big A2**: Marathon A2 but all the pieces are BIG!
